## 🔍 Understanding AI Capabilities

### What AI Can Do Well
✅ Generate structured diagrams
✅ Create repetitive patterns
✅ Layout elements in grids/rows
✅ Apply consistent styling
✅ Follow templates (flowchart, timeline, etc.)
✅ Understand spatial relationships
✅ Context-aware modifications

### What AI Struggles With
⚠️ Highly artistic/creative designs
⚠️ Pixel-perfect positioning
⚠️ Complex custom shapes
⚠️ Reading user's mind (be explicit!)
⚠️ Understanding vague descriptions

### Best Practices
1. **Start simple, add detail**: "Create a flowchart" → "Add colors" → "Add icons"
2. **Use standard terminology**: "flowchart", "org chart", "mind map" vs vague descriptions
3. **Provide examples**: "Like a Kanban board" helps AI understand
4. **Iterate**: Build complex diagrams step-by-step
5. **Give feedback**: "The circles are too small, make them bigger"

## 📖 Example Conversation Flow

```
You: "Create a software development lifecycle diagram"

AI: ✅ Created flowchart with 5 steps: Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment

You: "Add a feedback loop from Testing back to Development"

AI: ✅ Added arrow connecting Testing to Development

You: "Color code each phase - blue for planning, green for development, orange for testing"

AI: ✅ Applied color scheme to all phases

You: "Add icons to each step"

AI: ⚠️ I can add text labels or symbols, but detailed icons aren't available. 
     Would you like me to add emoji or text symbols instead?

You: "Yes, add relevant emoji to each step"

AI: ✅ Added emoji: 📋 Planning, 🎨 Design, 💻 Development, 🧪 Testing, 🚀 Deployment
```

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Save Good Prompts**: Keep a library of successful commands
2. **Use Templates**: Reference existing diagram types
3. **Combine Operations**: Chain multiple actions in one command
4. **Provide Feedback**: Help AI improve by correcting outputs
5. **Experiment**: Try different phrasings to find what works best

**Remember**: The AI learns from your commands. The more specific and clear you are, the better results you'll get!
